# WebTree

If you found a web directory with listing enable, you can use this tool to get the same output as the "tree" command on Linux.

You can use the option "-e" to exclude files with specific extensions from the output.

## Examples :
<code python>
python3 webtree.py https://example.org/uploads -e jpg,png
</code>
